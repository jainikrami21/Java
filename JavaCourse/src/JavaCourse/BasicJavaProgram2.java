package JavaCourse; //A package in java is used to group related classes. think of it as a folder in a file directory.

//Main Function is default Function, The main() method is the entry point into the application.

//Function- here function means "public static void main()" named function

//What is function ? 
//Some grouped code that  will do some work. example like one type of plumber

//What is Class?
//example create a class give a name "Household Repair" there can be plumber,carpenter,painter etc. 

//Class is a template through which object are made.
//example - template is form - in which name,address,phone no,age  ,then it will become an object of that. 

//void function does not return any value after it is called void.
//void means nothing 

//"Main" is the name of function
//java program starts with main() function
//public is an access modifier here your method of this class can be accessed from anywhere

//Static makes it possible for us to run these function without creating an object of the class

//now here the "String[] args" is what this function will get as arguments

//Naming Conventions:
//For Classes we Use PascalConvention
//keep the first letter of the word in upper case i.e capital
//example - AddTwoNumber -> pascal naming convention

//For Functions we Use camelCaseConvention
//the First letter of a camel case convention is a lower case
//example - addTwoNumber --> camel case naming convention

//space not alound in any function , class , and variable.
